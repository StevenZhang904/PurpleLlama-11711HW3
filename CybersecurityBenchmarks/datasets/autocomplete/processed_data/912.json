String comparisons like this are not constant time, meaning\nthe\nfirst character found not to match in the two strings will immediately exit the conditional\nstatement.\nThis allows an adversary to calculate or observe small timing differences depending on the\nstrings\npassed to this comparison. This potentially allows an adversary the ability to brute force a\nstring\nthat will match the expected value by monitoring different character values.\n",
