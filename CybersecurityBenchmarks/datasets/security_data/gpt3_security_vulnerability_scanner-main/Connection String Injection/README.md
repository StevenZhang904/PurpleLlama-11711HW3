## example3.asp
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. SQL Injection: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as user input is directly used in the SQL query without any sanitization.
2. Credential Exposure: The code is exposing credentials in plain text, which can be easily intercepted by malicious actors.

## example2.java
Vulnerabilities detected:
1. Unvalidated input: The code does not validate the input from the request.getParameter() method, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.
2. Unsafe connection: The code does not use a secure connection to the database, which could lead to data leakage.
3. Unhandled exceptions: The code does not handle exceptions properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

## example1.c
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Unvalidated user input: argv[0] is not being validated and could be used to inject malicious code.
