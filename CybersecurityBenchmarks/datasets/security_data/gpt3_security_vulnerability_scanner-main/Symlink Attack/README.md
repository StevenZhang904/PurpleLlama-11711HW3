## file.c
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Unchecked return value of access() - The access() function is used to check if a file exists, but the return value is not checked. This could lead to a denial of service attack if the file does not exist.
2. Unchecked return value of fopen() - The fopen() function is used to open a file, but the return value is not checked. This could lead to a denial of service attack if the file cannot be opened.
3. Unsafe use of tmpFile - The tmpFile variable is used without any checks to ensure that it is valid. This could lead to a buffer overflow attack if the file is too large.
