## redirect.js
No vulnerabilities detected.

## example1.php
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Unvalidated redirects and forwards: The code does not validate the value of the "go" parameter, which could allow an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious website.
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS): The code does not sanitize the "go" parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

## koa.js
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. No input validation on the query parameter 'target'. This could lead to a potential open redirect vulnerability.
2. No rate limiting on requests to the endpoint. This could lead to a potential denial of service attack.

## Remote Code Execution in apt-get
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Unvalidated input: The DeQuoteString() function is used to process the Req.Location parameter without any validation, which could lead to a potential injection attack.
2. Unsanitized output: The Redirect() function does not sanitize the NewURI parameter before outputting it, which could lead to a potential XSS attack.

## example1.rb
No vulnerabilities detected.
