Potential remote code execution vulnerability due to eval() method in __wakeup(). \n4. Use of eval() with $_GET which can lead to code injection attacks.\n\nNote: Additional sanitization should be implemented before user input is introduced to any eval() or unserialize() function to avoid vulnerability exploitation. Furthermore, eval() should be avoided where possible due to its inherent security risks."}
