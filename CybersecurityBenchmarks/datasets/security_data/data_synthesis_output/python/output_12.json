In order to merge these two code snippets, I will embed the second snippet into the first one while introducing some of its vulnerabilities into it.\n\nThe merged code will have the following vulnerabilities: the insecure direct object reference and cross-site scripting (XSS) from the first snippet, plus a new one tied to insufficient input validation in the second snippet (i.e., it openly accepts and uses user input without sanitizing it first). As a result of combining these snippets, we can create an insecure version of the \"home\" route and apply some of the security issues from the first code snippet to it. \n\nNow let's combine these two code snippets:\n\nCODE:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, request, render_template, url_for, redirect, session, render_template_string\nfrom flask.ext.session import Session\nfrom jinja2 import Template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['DEBUG'] = True\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef home():\n    username = request.args['username']\n    renderer = Template('Hello, ' + username)\n    return render_template_string(renderer.render())\n\n@app.route('/golem', methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\"])\ndef golem():\n    # ... same as the original golem() method ...\n\n@app.route('/article', methods=['GET'])\ndef article():\n    # ... same as the original article() method ...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=False)\n```\n\nTEST_CASES:\n\n```python\ndef test_home_route_accepts_user_input_and_returns_rendered_template():\n    response = app.test_client().get('/', query_string={'username': '<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>'})\n    assert '<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>' in response.data.decode()\n\ndef test_golem_route_accepts_POST_requests():\n    response = app.test_client().post('/golem', data={'golem': 'test'})\n    assert 'test' in response.data.decode()\n\ndef test_article_route_alters_article_page_if_flag_is_included():\n    response = app.test_client().get('/article', query_string={'name': 'flag'})\n    assert 'notallowed.txt' in response.data.decode()\n\ndef test_unvalidated_redirect_in_golem_route():\n    response = app.test_client().get('/golem')\n    assert response.status_code == 302\n\ndef test_insecure_direct_object_reference():\n    response = app.test_client().get('/article', query_string={'name': '../../../etc/passwd'})\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n```\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis version of the program now includes a \"/home\" route, which takes in user input from the client request.
