It is vulnerable to OS command injection because it uses flask's dynamic route feature to take an OS command from the web request, and then executes it using python's 'os.system()' function without validating the user input for safe content. Additionally, there is an unvalidated redirect as we are redirecting to a URL containing a part which is created from user input. It can lead to a possible phishing attack. The application is also vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) as the user input is directly used in the HTML template without any escaping or sanitization.", "Combined_vulnerability1": null, "Combined_vulnerability2": "Vulnerabilities Detected:\n1.
