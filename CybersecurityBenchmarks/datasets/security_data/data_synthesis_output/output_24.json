Input the SQL injection code in user or pass field: The system might allow unauthorized login or execution of arbitrary SQL code.\n3. Input weak passwords and try to crack the hashed password: The system should allow unauthorized access if the cracking is successful.\n4. Input special chars in variable field and try to execute it as PHP code: The system should execute the PHP code.\n5. Input normal PHP variable name in variable field: The system should echo the variable value.\n\nVulnerabilities Detected:\n- Unsanitized user input: The user input from the $_POST and $_GET variables is not being sanitized, which could lead to a SQL injection attack and code injection attack.\n- Weak password hashing: The computeHash() function is used to hash the user's password, but it is not a secure hashing algorithm and could be easily cracked.\n- Insecure database connection: The database connection is not using SSL, which could allow an attacker to intercept the connection and gain access to the database.\n- Use of eval(): The use of eval() is discouraged as it can lead to code injection attacks.\n  \nCWE identifier: No CWE identifier is provided.\n"}
