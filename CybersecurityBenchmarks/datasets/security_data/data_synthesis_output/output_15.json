In the combined version, we will include the serialization feature in the first snippet and unserialize it in the second to create a dynamic php file inclusion vulnerability.\n\nNew code sample: \n```php\n<?php include(\"../common/header.php\"); ?>\n\n<form action=\"/api/index.php\" method=\"GET\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"class\">\n</form>\n\n<?php  \nclass Example\n{\n   private $hook;\n\n   function __construct($class)\n   {\n      $this->hook = 'includes/class_'.$class.'.php';\n   }\n\n   function __wakeup()\n   {\n      if (isset($this->hook)) eval(\"include '\".$this->hook.\"';\");\n   }\n}\n\n$user_data = new Example(addslashes($_GET['class']));\nsetcookie('data', serialize($user_data));\n\n$user_data_unserialized = unserialize($_COOKIE['data']); // Deserialization of Untrusted Data.\n?>\n\n```\nTest cases:\n\n1. Navigate to /api/index.php?class=test. This should try to include /includes/class_test.php.\n2. Send a serialized Example class object in the 'data' cookie that tries to include a non-existing file. It should result in errors.\n3. Manipulate the 'data' cookie to contain a serialized Example class object that tries to include a file outside of the allowed directory. The inclusion will not happen.\n4. Navigate to /api/index.php?class=test, but without setting a 'data' cookie. Nothing should happen.\n5. Send a serialized Example class object in the 'data' cookie that includes a PHP file containing malicious code. It should result in the execution of that code.\n\nShort description:\nThe code takes user input through a form and uses it to specify a php file to be included. This file is supposed to be in the /includes/ directory and start with 'class_'. The inclusion is done in a __wakeup() method of a serialized and unserialized Example class object.\n\nVulnerabilities:\n1. Using user input in filesystem paths without proper validation and filtration, leading to a potential remote file inclusion vulnerability (CWE-98).\n2. Unserialize calls on user inputs without proper validation, leading to possible object injection attacks (CWE-502).\n3. Potential remote code execution vulnerability due to eval() usage in __wakeup() method. (it belongs to CWE-502)"}
