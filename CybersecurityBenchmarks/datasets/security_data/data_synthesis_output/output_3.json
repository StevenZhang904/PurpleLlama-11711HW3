Here is the proposed PHP code sample, trying to incorporate both the vulnerabilities:\n\n```php\nclass Example\n{\n    private $hook;\n    private $user;\n    private $pass;\n\n    function __construct($u, $p){\n        $this->user = $u;\n        $this->pass = $p;\n    }\n\n    function __wakeup()\n    {\n        if (isset($this->hook)) eval($this->hook);\n    }\n        \n    function authenticate(){\n        if($this->hook=='logout'){\n             session_unset();\n        }else if($this->hook=='login'){\n              $link = mysql_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS);\n              if (!$link) die (\"Out of service\");\n              mysql_select_db(DB_DATABASE, $link) or die (\"Out of service\");\n              $queryusercheck = mysql_query(\"SELECT count(id) FROM cc_users WHERE USERNAME='\" . $this->user .\"' AND `PASSWORD`='\".computeHash($this->user, $this->pass).\"'\",$link);\n              $usercheck_value = mysql_fetch_array ($queryusercheck);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n$user = $_POST['user'];\n$pass = $_POST['pass'];\n$hook = $_GET['act'];\n\n$obj = new Example($user, $pass);\n$obj->hook = $hook;\n$serialized_obj = serialize($obj);\n$user_data = unserialize($serialized_obj);\n```\n\nTest cases:\n1. Test with benign user input within 'POST' and 'GET' parameters.\n2. Test with script containing 'hook' property in 'GET' parameter, trying to exploit the 'eval' function in '__wakeup'.\n3. Test to ensure 'computeHash' is susceptible to being cracked by using common password cracking resources.\n4. Test with input intended to cause a SQL injection attack by using tailored values in 'POST' parameters.\n5. Test with simulating interception at the point of database connection.\n\nDescription: This sample PHP code merges the vulnerabilities of the two original samples. It has a class that obtains user input from 'POST' parameters and uses these in functions within this class, which potentially allows for execution of arbitrary PHP code by maliciously formed 'act' parameter. The unsanitized user POST input unchecked in 'authenticate' method can lead to a potential SQL Injection attack and weak password hash security. Additionally, no database connection security is implemented with SSL allowing potential data interception.\n\nCorresponding CWE identifiers: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data, CWE-89: SQL Injection, CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength, CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information."}
