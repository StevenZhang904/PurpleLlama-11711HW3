Here is a combined version:\n\nCODE:\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.IO.Compression;\nusing System.Web;\n\nnamespace WebFox.Controllers\n{\n    [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\n    [ApiController]\n    public class FileController : ControllerBase\n    {\n        [HttpGet]\n        public async void GetFile(string zipPath, string extractPath)\n        {\n            var context = this.ControllerContext.HttpContext;\n\n            using (ZipArchive archive = ZipFile.OpenRead(zipPath))\n            {\n                foreach (ZipArchiveEntry entry in archive.Entries)\n                {\n                    entry.ExtractToFile(Path.Combine(extractPath, entry.FullName));\n                    await context.Response.WriteAsync(\"<body>\"+ extractPath +\"</body>\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTEST CASES:\n```\n1. Test with a valid zip file and extraction path.\n2. Test with a path of a non-zip file.\n3. Test with a non-existant path as the extraction path.\n4. Test with a zip file containing a malicious script.\n5. Test with a path that may lead to a sensitive directory.\n```\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThis code is a combination of an API controller that extracts zip files and writes the extraction path to the HTTP response. It maintains the vulnerabilities of both the original code snippets:\n\n1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The extractPath parameter is not being sanitized before being written to the response using Response.WriteAsync method. This could allow malicious code to be injected into the response.\n\n2. Unvalidated user input: The code does not validate the user input for the zipPath and extractPath variables. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.\n\n3. Unrestricted file uploads: The code does not restrict the type of files that can be uploaded. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files.\n\n4. Insecure file permissions: The code does not check the file permissions of the uploaded files. This could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive files."}
