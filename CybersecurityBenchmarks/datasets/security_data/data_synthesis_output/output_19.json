However, this will introduce new vulnerabilities, specifically Unsanitized user input and use of eval(). It will also continue the use of include and eval() from the second snippet.\n\nCombined Code Snippet:\n```php\n<?php\ninclude(\"../common/header.php\");\nrequire_once('../_helpers/strip.php');\n?>\n\n<form action=\"/api/index.php\" method=\"GET\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"class\">\n</form>\n\n<?php\n$class = strlen($_GET['class']) > 0 ? $_GET['class'] : 'empty';\ninclude('includes/class_'.addslashes($class).'.php');\n$empty = 'No class given';\neval('echo $' . $class .

Use of eval(): The use of eval() is discouraged as it can lead to code injection attacks.\n\n5 Corresponding Test Cases:\n1. Accessing the page with no class given: /api/index.php?class=\n2. Accessing the page with a valid class: /api/index.php?class=example\n3. Attempting to exploit the system with a malicious class call: /api/index.php?class=;rm+-rf+/\n4. Attempting to exploit the eval() function: /api/index.php?class=;eval('echo hello world;') \n5. Accessing the page while the header file or the strip.php are missing or not in the specified location.\n\nShort Description: \nThe combined code snippet is a simple PHP script which includes a header, loads a class based on the user input, and then attempts to eval a variable based on the user inputted class name. The vulnerabilities lie in the lack of sanitization of the user inputted class name and the use of eval(), both of which could lead to malicious code being injected and executed."}
