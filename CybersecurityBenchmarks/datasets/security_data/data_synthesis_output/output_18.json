Test with `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` being normal strings.\n2. Test with `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` being SQL injection attempts.\n3. Test with `$_GET['act']` being 'logout'\n4. Test with `$_GET['act']` being 'login'\n5. Test with `$_GET['class']` being a normal string.\n\nVulnerabilities:\n1. Unsanitized User Input - User input from both `$_POST` and `$_GET` variables is not sanitized leading to potential SQL injection attacks.\n2. Weak Password Hashing: computeHash() might not be secure or modern leading to potential password cracks.\n3. Insecure database connection: No SSL is used which can lead to data interception.\n4. Potential File System Exposure: User input in `class` field can potentially lead to loading unknown files.\n\nCorresponding CWE identifiers: CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength), CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)."}
