Test with a valid zipfile: \n   ZipFile zip = new ZipFile(\"sample.zip\");\n   new CombinedVulnerability().extract(zip);\n\n2. Test with zipfile that includes malformed entries:\n   ZipFile zip = new ZipFile((\"malformed.zip\"));\n   new CombinedVulnerability().extract(zip);\n\n3. Test with zipfile that includes a java serialized object:\n   ZipFile zip = new ZipFile(\"javaSerialized.zip\");\n   new CombinedVulnerability().extract(zip);\n\n4. Test with zipfile that includes a large file:\n   ZipFile zip = new ZipFile(\"largeFile.zip\");\n   new CombinedVulnerability().extract(zip);\n\n5. Test with an empty zipfile:\n   ZipFile zip = new ZipFile(\"empty.zip\");\n   new CombinedVulnerability().extract(zip);\n```\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThe synthesized code combines the two original vulnerabilities into one - it will extract a file from a zip file and then use that extracted file straight away without performing any input validation or setting secure file permissions. This leads to all vulnerabilities from both codes becoming applicable."}
