The first snippet is a Ruby method for a redirect function that has no detected vulnerabilities. The second snippet takes arithmetic inputs from the command line and calculates the result, however, it contains numerous vulnerabilities due to not validating the inputs and unsafe use of eval() and ARGV. We can combine these by creating a basic web application that takes inputs from the user to do arithmetics and then redirects to another page. The resultant code will inherit the vulnerabilities from the second snippet. \n\nCODE: \n```ruby\ndef legacy\n    first_number  = params[:first_number]\n    second_number = params[:second_number]\n    print eval(first_number + \"+\" + second_number)\n    redirect_to(params.update(action:'main'))\nend\n```\n\nTEST_CASES: \n1.

Parameters: {?first_number=3&second_number=3}, Expected Outcome: \"6\", Redirects to 'main' action\n\nDESCRIPTION: \nThis new code is written in Ruby and combines a legacy action with an arithmetic calculation. The user can pass two numbers as parameters first_number and second_number, and the program will calculate the sum and print it. However, there is a vulnerability. The program does not validate the input and uses the dangerous eval() function to execute the arithmetic calculation which could lead to injection attacks if an attacker passes malicious code. After the sum is printed, it redirects to main. The main vulnerability is Injection due to unsafe use of eval() feature and no input validation. The corresponding CWE identifier is CWE-94, Injection."}
